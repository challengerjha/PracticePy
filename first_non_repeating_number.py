# Given a string s, find the first non-repeating character in it and return its index. If it does not exist, return -1.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: s = "leetcode"

# Output: 0

# Explanation:

# The character 'l' at index 0 is the first character that does not occur at any other index.

class Solution:
    def firstUniqChar(self, s: str) -> int:
        char_count = defaultdict(int)
        for char in s:
            char_count[char] += 1
            
        for index, char in enumerate(s):
            if char_count[char] == 1:
                return index
            return -1
